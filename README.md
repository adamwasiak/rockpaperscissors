## Milestone Project 2
### Purpose 
This simple online game was created for the purpose of completing the second Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Diploma in Software Development (E-commerce Applications). The website was built using the knowledge gained from the HTML, CSS Modules as well as recently JavaScript content of the course.
The target audience for this website are users who would like to avail of quick, simple online game of Rock Paper Scissors.
Whilst there are many varieties of this classic game available online, the objective of the website is also to attract user to game's visual appeal.

## User Experience Design  

The key objective of the game from user experience perspective was to keep it simple and visually appealing. 
The focus was on keeping the game visual with limited text content limited to key information.


## Game design 
The game consists of 1 page, the homepage, where the actual game play takes place. 

-**Concept** the key concept was to create a simple, eye pleasing game, with a well-balanced contrasts and color, and also with good level of responsiveness to users' actions.

-**Colors and background**- the colors are primarily grey and black in terms of fonts and background.

-**Typography** – I have selected font “Special Elite” with sans-serif as a fall-back font for the entire content of the website. The specific font of “Special Elite” was sourced from Google Fonts library.
